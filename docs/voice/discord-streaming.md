This repo supports native Discord Go Live in both directions:

- Native Discord screen watch: subscribe to an active Discord Go Live stream through Discord's voice media protocol.
- Native Discord self publish: create our own Go Live stream and send H264 video through the stream server connection.
- Share-link fallback: send `/share/:token`, capture with `getDisplayMedia()`, and POST JPEG frames back into the bot.
  This transport can be disabled completely with `STREAM_LINK_FALLBACK=false`.

The model still only sees `start_screen_watch` for inbound visual context. Outbound publish is a runtime capability tied to the music pipeline, not a new conversational tool.

In the full-brain voice path, `start_screen_watch` is exposed as soon as native
screen watch is supported and enabled for the session, even if only discovered
Go Live state exists and no active share has been bound yet. That lets the
brain initiate OP20 `STREAM_WATCH` in response to "can you see my stream now?"
instead of waiting for a fully ready watch state or frame-backed sharer roster
before the tool appears.

## Current Status

**Status validated March 13, 2026.**

The native Discord screen watch pipeline is built end to end in clankvox and Bun:

- selfbot gateway stream discovery for `VOICE_STATE_UPDATE.self_stream`,
  `STREAM_CREATE`, `STREAM_SERVER_UPDATE`, `STREAM_DELETE`, and
  `GUILD_CREATE` voice state scan for pre-existing streamers on connect
- Gateway OP20 `STREAM_WATCH` request dispatch from the selfbot session
- `clankvox` `stream_watch` IPC + second transport role
- video receive, DAVE decrypt, H264/VP8 depacketization, IPC, ffmpeg decode, stream-watch ingest
- explicit-target native watch can start from discovered Go Live state before
  native video-state frames have populated the sharer list
- Bun normalizes H264 payloads to Annex-B before `ffmpeg` decode so length-prefixed
  AVC access units do not fail decode by shape alone

**Validated live** on the selfbot runtime (March 13, 2026):

- the selfbot receives stream discovery events
- `STREAM_WATCH` yields stream credentials
- Bun forwards those credentials into `clankvox`
- `clankvox` opens the second stream transport, completes the modern watcher handshake,
  reaches DAVE-ready, and forwards encrypted H264 frames back to Bun
- DAVE MLS E2EE session completes successfully on the stream watch transport, though per-frame video decrypt currently fails for Go Live (frames arrive during the post-commit unencrypted window instead)
- ffmpeg decodes sampled VP8 keyframes and H264 access units (IDR or SPS+PPS+P-slice) to JPEG successfully
- stream-watch brain context pipeline ingests frames and produces accurate visual commentary
- DAVE channel ID derivation (`BigInt(rtcServerId) - 1`) confirmed working
- two-checkpoint link fallback suppression prevents duplicate transports when native watch is active

The native Discord self-publish path is also built in code:

- selfbot gateway can send OP18 `STREAM_CREATE`, OP19 `STREAM_DELETE`, and OP22 `STREAM_SET_PAUSED`
- Bun tracks self stream discovery and routes self-owned credentials into a dedicated `stream_publish` transport role
- `clankvox` opens a second sender-side stream connection, advertises H264, encrypts video with DAVE, and packetizes outbound RTP
- Bun currently drives publish from two source families:
  - music/video relay: start on music play, pause on music pause, stop on music idle/error
  - browser-session share: explicit `share_browser_session` start/stop around an active browser session
- `voice.streamWatch.visualizerMode` controls how music publish renders:
  - `"cqt"` is the default and starts one shared `ffmpeg` pipeline inside `clankvox` that emits PCM for the main voice connection and H264 visualizer access units for Go Live
  - `stream_publish_play_visualizer` attaches the sender transport to that already-running visualizer feed instead of starting a second media fetch
  - `"off"` preserves the legacy URL-backed source-video relay path when a real source video track is preferred
- music publish is no longer limited to YouTube-backed video tracks when a visualizer is active; any playback URL the music pipeline already resolved for the active track can drive the visualizer

Sender-side live Discord validation is still pending in this repo snapshot. What is validated today is protocol shape, transport wiring, automated coverage for create/resume/switch control-plane behavior, browser-session frame forwarding coverage in Bun, and `cargo test` coverage inside `clankvox`.

The share-link fallback remains the recovery transport if native watch does not
connect or later becomes unhealthy. When the native `stream_watch` transport
fails or disconnects after start, Bun tears the native watch down and requests
the share-link path directly when requester + text-channel context are known.

Set `STREAM_LINK_FALLBACK=false` to disable that transport entirely. In that
mode, runtime stays native-only: capability reporting stops advertising the
share-link path, native startup failures do not create fallback sessions, and
post-connect transport failures log a skipped recovery instead of issuing a
share-link request.

### Link fallback suppression

When a native stream watch is active, the link fallback is suppressed at two
checkpoints inside `tryStartLinkFallback`:

1. **pre_create** — before creating the link session, check if native watch is
   already active for the target user with a ready transport or decoded frame
2. **post_compose** — after composing the link message but before sending, re-check
   in case native watch became ready during async link creation

This prevents the race where the voice brain's `start_screen_watch` tool call
resolves before stream credentials arrive, triggers a link fallback, and then
native watch connects 200ms later — resulting in both transports running in
parallel. `shouldSuppressLinkFallbackDueToNativeWatch` checks transport status,
decoded frame presence, or active sharer state.

If the brain asks for `start_screen_watch` again for the same target while the
native watch is already active, Bun reuses that watch instead of reconnecting
the `stream_watch` transport. Tool results now separate transport attachment
from visual readiness: `frameReady=false` means the watch is up but no decoded
or buffered image frame exists yet, so the agent should not claim it can
already see the screen.

`startVoiceScreenWatch` also accepts a `preferredTransport` parameter. Callers
can pass `"link"` to skip native entirely and go straight to the share-link
path — used for recovery when native transport fails after initial connection.
If `STREAM_LINK_FALLBACK=false`, `"link"` requests are rejected.

## Why The Regular Voice Connection Cannot See Go Live Streams

Discord uses a **dual-connection architecture** for Go Live:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Regular Voice Connection                                   │
│  - Audio (Opus) send/receive                                │
│  - Speaking state (OP5)                                     │
│  - DAVE encryption                                          │
│  - No Go Live video SSRCs on the main voice leg             │
│  - No OP12 video state received                             │
│  - Endpoint: from VOICE_SERVER_UPDATE                       │
│  - Server ID: guild_id                                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Stream Connection (separate voice server)                  │
│  - Video frame send/receive                                 │
│  - Video SSRCs assigned in OP2 Ready streams[] array        │
│  - OP12 video state exchanged                               │
│  - OP15 media sink wants for quality negotiation            │
│  - Endpoint: from STREAM_SERVER_UPDATE                      │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Confirmed via live debugging in the older bot-token runtime on March 12, 2026:

- OP2 Ready on the main voice connection returned `video_ssrc=None`
- No OP12 or OP18 video state was ever sent to the main voice connection
- Adding `video: true` and `streams` to the main voice Identify payload did not change this
- Sending OP12 on the main voice connection did not change this either

The selfbot fork changes the account/control-plane model, not the fact that Go Live uses a separate stream server connection.

Go Live video state and video frames live on a separate stream server that requires its own connection.

## Discord Protocol: Go Live Stream Architecture

### Gateway events (main Discord gateway, not voice gateway)

These are standard Discord gateway dispatch events, not voice WebSocket opcodes:

| Gateway opcode | Event name | Direction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 18 | `STREAM_CREATE` | Client → Server | Start a Go Live stream |
| 19 | `STREAM_DELETE` | Client → Server | Stop a Go Live stream |
| 20 | `STREAM_WATCH` | Client → Server | Subscribe to watch someone's stream |
| 22 | `STREAM_SET_PAUSED` | Client → Server | Pause/resume a stream |

Gateway dispatch events received from Discord:

| Event | Payload | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `STREAM_CREATE` | `{ stream_key, rtc_server_id }` | Stream created, provides stream server ID |
| `STREAM_SERVER_UPDATE` | `{ stream_key, endpoint, token }` | Stream server ready, provides connection credentials |
| `STREAM_DELETE` | `{ stream_key }` | Stream ended |
| `VOICE_STATE_UPDATE` | `{ ..., self_stream, self_video }` | User voice state, includes streaming flag |

### Stream key format

Stream keys identify a specific Go Live stream:

```
guild:<guildId>:<channelId>:<userId>    # Guild voice channel
call:<channelId>:<userId>               # DM / group call
```

### Voice gateway opcodes (on the stream connection)

These are the same opcodes as the regular voice connection but exchanged on the stream-specific voice server:

| Voice opcode | Name | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `IDENTIFY` | Authenticate with stream server |
| 1 | `SELECT_PROTOCOL` | Negotiate codecs and encryption |
| 2 | `READY` | Server assigns SSRCs (including video SSRCs in `streams[]`) |
| 4 | `SELECT_PROTOCOL_ACK` | Session description with encryption keys |
| 5 | `SPEAKING` | Signal speaking/streaming status (flag 2 = video) |
| 12 | `VIDEO` | Announce/receive video stream attributes |
| 15 | `MEDIA_SINK_WANTS` | Request specific video quality/SSRCs |

## Protocol Flow: Watching a Go Live Stream

### Sending (reference control-plane shape)

```
1. joinVoice()
   → Gateway OP4 VOICE_STATE_UPDATE { guild_id, channel_id }
   → Receive VOICE_STATE_UPDATE { session_id }
   → Receive VOICE_SERVER_UPDATE { endpoint, token }
   → Connect regular voice WebSocket to endpoint
   → Standard voice handshake (OP0→OP2→OP1→OP4)

2. createStream()
   → Gateway OP18 STREAM_CREATE { type, guild_id, channel_id }
   → Gateway OP22 STREAM_SET_PAUSED { stream_key, paused: false }
   → Receive STREAM_CREATE { stream_key, rtc_server_id }
   → Receive STREAM_SERVER_UPDATE { stream_key, endpoint, token }
   → Connect stream voice WebSocket to stream endpoint
   → Stream handshake: OP0 Identify with { server_id: rtc_server_id, video: true, streams: [...] }
   → OP2 Ready includes video SSRCs in streams[] array
   → OP12 VIDEO to announce stream attributes
   → Send video frames via RTP/UDP
```

### Publishing / sending (runtime flow)

```
1. A publishable source becomes active
   → music playback resolves a publishable source URL
   → if `voice.streamWatch.visualizerMode != "off"`, `music_play` starts one shared `ffmpeg` pipeline that emits both PCM audio and H264 visualizer video
   → if `voice.streamWatch.visualizerMode == "off"`, Bun keeps the legacy URL-backed source-video relay path
   → browser-session share resolves a live browser session key

2. Create or reuse self stream
   → If no self stream exists, send OP18 STREAM_CREATE
   → Send OP22 STREAM_SET_PAUSED { paused: false }
   → Wait for STREAM_CREATE + STREAM_SERVER_UPDATE discovery

3. Connect sender transport
   → Bun sends stream_publish_connect to clankvox
   → clankvox opens stream voice connection to stream endpoint
   → OP0 Identify uses rtc_server_id + main voice session_id
   → OP1 SelectProtocol advertises sender-side H264
   → OP12 VIDEO announces active screen stream attributes

4. Push media
   → visualizer-mode music publish sends `stream_publish_play_visualizer`
   → clankvox attaches the sender transport to the shared music visualizer H264 queue
   → legacy URL-backed music publish sends `stream_publish_play`
   → browser-session share sends stream_publish_browser_start + stream_publish_browser_frame payloads into clankvox
   → clankvox encodes or relays the active source to H264 Annex-B access units
   → DAVE encrypt + RTP packetize each access unit
   → OP5 speaking uses flag 2 on the stream connection

5. Pause / stop
   → music pause sends OP22 STREAM_SET_PAUSED { paused: true }
   → music resume reuses the same stream when discovery is still live
   → browser-session share stop sends OP19 STREAM_DELETE and tears the sender transport down
   → music stop/error/idle sends OP19 STREAM_DELETE and tears the sender transport down
```

### Receiving / watching (runtime flow)

```
1. Detect Go Live
   → Listen for VOICE_STATE_UPDATE with self_stream: true
   → Seed provisional session Go Live state from that early signal
   → OR listen for STREAM_CREATE dispatch event
   → OR scan GUILD_CREATE voice_states on connect for users already streaming

2. Subscribe to stream
   → Gateway OP20 STREAM_WATCH { stream_key }
   → If STREAM_CREATE has not arrived yet, synthesize stream_key from guild/channel/user IDs
   → Receive STREAM_CREATE { stream_key, rtc_server_id }
   → Receive STREAM_SERVER_UPDATE { stream_key, endpoint, token }

3. Connect to stream server
   → Open second voice WebSocket to stream endpoint
   → OP0 Identify with { server_id: rtc_server_id, video: true, streams: [...] }
   → OP2 Ready assigns video SSRCs in streams[] array
   → OP12 VIDEO with video state from the streamer

4. Request video quality
    → OP15 MEDIA_SINK_WANTS with `streams`, `pixelCounts`, and `any` default quality

 5. Receive video frames
    → Encrypted RTP/UDP video packets arrive
    → Transport decrypt (AES-GCM/XChaCha20) → depacketize H264/VP8 → DAVE decrypt attempt
    → DAVE video decrypt currently fails for Go Live (frames forwarded from post-commit unencrypted window)
    → ffmpeg decode to JPEG → stream-watch pipeline
```

### OP0 Identify (stream connection)

```json
{
  "op": 0,
  "d": {
    "server_id": "<rtc_server_id from STREAM_CREATE>",
    "user_id": "<selfbot user id>",
    "session_id": "<session_id from VOICE_STATE_UPDATE>",
    "token": "<token from STREAM_SERVER_UPDATE>",
    "video": true,
    "streams": [{ "type": "screen", "rid": "100", "quality": 100 }],
    "max_dave_protocol_version": 1
  }
}
```

### OP2 Ready (stream connection response)

```json
{
  "op": 2,
  "d": {
    "ssrc": 12345,
    "ip": "1.2.3.4",
    "port": 50000,
    "modes": ["aead_aes256_gcm_rtpsize", "aead_xchacha20_poly1305_rtpsize"],
    "streams": [
      {
        "type": "video",
        "rid": "100",
        "ssrc": 12346,
        "rtx_ssrc": 12347,
        "active": false,
        "quality": 100
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Video SSRCs are in `d.streams[].ssrc`, not in a top-level `d.video_ssrc` field.

### OP15 Media Sink Wants

`clankvox` sends Discord media sink wants with `streams` and `pixelCounts`
maps plus a top-level `any` default quality:

```json
{
  "op": 15,
  "d": {
    "any": 100,
    "streams": {
      "12346": 100,
      "12347": 0
    },
    "pixelCounts": {
      "12346": 921600.0,
      "12347": 230400.0
    }
  }
}
```

The `pixelCounts` map is required for Discord to send video at the requested
resolution. Without it, Discord may send the lowest quality layer where
keyframes are very sparse. The `any` field provides a default quality for
SSRCs not explicitly listed.

### Stream speaking flag

On the stream connection, speaking flag 2 indicates video (vs flag 1 for audio on the regular connection):

```json
{ "op": 5, "d": { "speaking": 2, "delay": 0, "ssrc": 12345 } }
```

## What Is Built

### Video receive pipeline (clankvox, Rust)

All of this is implemented and tested:

- OP12/OP18 remote video state parsing and tracking (`voice_conn.rs`)
- OP14 session/codec update handling (`voice_conn.rs`)
- OP15 media sink wants send (`voice_conn.rs`, `capture_supervisor.rs`)
- Protected RTCP receiver-report / PLI / FIR keyframe feedback while waiting for the first renderable stream frame (`voice_conn.rs`, `capture_supervisor.rs`)
- Video codec advertisement in SelectProtocol: H264, VP8 decode (`voice_conn.rs`)
- Non-Opus RTP acceptance: H264 (PT 103), VP8 (PT 105) (`voice_conn.rs`)
- DAVE video decrypt path (`dave.rs`)
- H264 depacketization: single NAL, STAP-A, FU-A (`video.rs`)
- VP8 depacketization: payload descriptor stripping, frame reassembly (`video.rs`)
- RTP sequence gap detection to prevent cross-packet frame corruption (`video.rs`)
- Video frame IPC: `UserVideoState`, `UserVideoFrame`, `UserVideoEnd` (`ipc.rs`)
- Dedicated bounded outbound video queue with backpressure logging (`ipc.rs`)
- Per-user video subscription management (`capture_supervisor.rs`)
- Remote video state merge semantics for partial updates (`capture_supervisor.rs`)
- Session reconnect teardown of stale video state (`capture_supervisor.rs`)

### Audio receive pipeline (clankvox, Rust)

All of this is implemented and tested:

- OP5 speaking payload parsing into the audio SSRC map (`voice_conn.rs`)
- DAVE audio decrypt on the main voice transport (`dave.rs`, `voice_conn.rs`)
- Audio SSRC remap fallback from successful DAVE decrypt when OP5 is delayed or missing (`voice_conn.rs`)
- Opus decode plus PCM downmix/resample into Bun-visible `UserAudio` IPC (`capture_supervisor.rs`, `audio_pipeline.rs`, `ipc.rs`)

### Bun runtime integration

- `clankvoxClient.ts`: IPC for `subscribe_user_video`, `unsubscribe_user_video`, video events
- `nativeDiscordScreenShare.ts`: Active sharer tracking, target resolution
- `sessionLifecycle.ts`: Video state/frame/end event handlers
- `screenShare.ts`: Native-first with share-link fallback, telemetry
- `voiceStreamWatch.ts`: ffmpeg H264/VP8 keyframe decode to JPEG, stream-watch pipeline

### Video send pipeline (clankvox + Bun)

Implemented in code:

- `streamDiscovery.ts`: OP18/OP19/OP22 send helpers plus self stream discovery
- `voiceStreamPublish.ts`: session state, visualizer-aware source resolution, and self-stream connect orchestration
- `voiceBrowserStreamPublish.ts`: browser-session capture loop and frame forwarding into `clankvox`
- `sessionLifecycle.ts`: publish transport lifecycle, recovery, and stream discovery callbacks
- `clankvoxClient.ts`: `stream_publish_*` IPC commands, including `stream_publish_play_visualizer`, and transport state relay
- `clankvox`: sender-side `stream_publish` transport role, H264 codec negotiation, DAVE video encrypt, RTP packetization, shared music visualizer pipeline, legacy URL relay, and browser-frame encode path

Current rollout boundary:

- outbound publish is wired to music/video relay and explicit browser-session share, not a general-purpose arbitrary file/share tool
- music relay defaults to a shared audio visualizer (`voice.streamWatch.visualizerMode: "cqt"`) and only falls back to source-video relay when that setting is `"off"`
- sender transport is H264-only

### What is still open

1. **RTX retransmission receive** — the current UDP receive path still drops RTX packets, so packet-loss recovery remains limited until retransmission support lands
2. **Live sender validation** — the sender path is implemented, but this repo snapshot still needs Discord-live validation against a real selfbot session
3. **Broader publish surfaces** — outbound publish still centers on music lifecycle and explicit browser-session share; there is no general-purpose arbitrary file/share tool yet

## Implementation Plan

### Current Receive Flow

- Selfbot gateway records active Go Live streams and credentials in stream discovery state
- On connect (or full reconnect), `GUILD_CREATE` voice states are scanned for users with `self_stream: true` to detect streams that were already active before the bot connected
- `start_screen_watch` requests OP20 `STREAM_WATCH` and records the expected stream key on the voice session
- If credentials are already present, Bun immediately sends `stream_watch_connect` to `clankvox`
- If credentials arrive later, discovery callbacks connect the `stream_watch` transport when `STREAM_SERVER_UPDATE` lands
- `clankvox` emits role-aware `transport_state`, `userVideoState`, `userVideoFrame`, and `userVideoEnd`
- Bun decodes sampled VP8 keyframes and H264 IDR access units to JPEG and feeds them into the existing stream-watch commentary path
- `STREAM_DELETE` prunes the cached sharer and tears native watch down
- Native transport failure/disconnect tears native watch down and directly requests share-link fallback when requester + text-channel context exist

### Current Publish Flow

- music playback enters `playing`
- `voiceMusicPlayback.ts` resolves the playback URL for the active track and starts `music_play`
- if `voice.streamWatch.visualizerMode != "off"`, `music_play` starts a shared `ffmpeg` pipeline in `clankvox` that emits PCM audio plus H264 visualizer access units
- `voiceStreamPublish.ts` resolves a publishable source from session music state or an active browser-session share
- if no self stream exists yet, Bun sends OP18 `STREAM_CREATE`
- self stream discovery callbacks hand `STREAM_CREATE` / `STREAM_SERVER_UPDATE` credentials back into the owning voice session
- Bun sends `stream_publish_connect`, then either `stream_publish_play_visualizer` for shared visualizer mode or `stream_publish_play` for legacy URL relay
- `clankvox` starts or reuses the sender-side stream transport, marks video active, and sends H264 RTP frames
- music pause sends `stream_publish_pause` plus OP22 `paused: true`
- music resume reuses the live stream when possible instead of recreating it
- music idle/error/stop sends `stream_publish_stop`, `stream_publish_disconnect`, and OP19 `STREAM_DELETE`

## Product Behavior

The model still only sees `start_screen_watch`. Runtime resolves transport:

1. Check if target user has `self_stream: true` (Go Live active)
2. If yes → open stream connection, subscribe, receive native frames
3. If no → fall back to share-link path

The share-link fallback remains the recovery path when:

- The target user is not Go Live sharing
- Stream connection fails to establish
- Selfbot stream subscription fails or the native transport is unavailable
- Multiple sharers are active and target is ambiguous

## Settings

Native subscription tuning and music Go Live visualizer settings live under `voice.streamWatch`:

- `visualizerMode` (default: `"cqt"`)
- `nativeDiscordMaxFramesPerSecond` (default: 2)
- `nativeDiscordPreferredQuality` (default: 100)
- `nativeDiscordPreferredPixelCount` (default: 921600 / 1280x720)
- `nativeDiscordPreferredStreamType` (default: `"screen"`)

There is no separate standalone settings block for outbound native publish. Music playback reuses `voice.streamWatch.visualizerMode` to choose between the shared audio-visualizer path and the legacy source-video relay path.

### Brain Context Mode

`voice.streamWatch.brainContextMode` controls how the bot processes screen share frames:

- **`direct`** (default): No vision triage model. Frames are sent directly to the main voice brain as image attachments. The brain sees the screen itself and decides whether to speak. The brain can write `[[NOTE:your observation]]` directives to maintain private self-notes about what it has seen — these persist as rolling context for future turns, but the images themselves are ephemeral (fire and forget). A `[SKIP] [[NOTE:...]]` output means "I see this, I'm noting it, but I have nothing to say right now."

Direct mode settings:
- `directMinIntervalSeconds` (default: 10, range: 3–120): minimum gap between direct brain turns
- `directMaxEntries` (default: 12): maximum rolling self-note buffer size

- **`context_brain`**: A separate vision triage model analyzes each frame and produces a short note + urgency classification (`high` / `low` / `none`). Only `high` urgency frames trigger a main brain turn. Notes accumulate as rolling context injected into all subsequent voice brain replies. Lower cost per frame, but the brain only sees triage summaries rather than the actual screen.

Direct mode is the default because it is more aligned with agent autonomy — the bot decides what is interesting, not a separate triage model. It is more expensive per frame since the main brain processes the full conversation context plus an image on each turn, but produces richer, more contextual reactions. Operators who need to optimize cost can switch to `context_brain`.

## Observability

### Stream discovery layer (implemented)

- `native_discord_go_live_detected` — selfbot gateway saw `self_stream: true`
- `stream_discovery_existing_streamer_detected` — `GUILD_CREATE` voice state scan found a user already streaming on connect
- `stream_discovery_guild_create_scan_complete` — `GUILD_CREATE` scan finished with count of existing streamers found
- `stream_discovery_go_live_bootstrap_seeded` — Bun seeded provisional session Go Live state from `self_stream: true`
- `stream_discovery_go_live_bootstrap_cleared` — Bun cleared stale provisional session Go Live state after `self_stream: false`
- `native_discord_stream_watch_requested` — Gateway OP20 sent
- `native_discord_stream_server_received` — `STREAM_SERVER_UPDATE` received
- `native_discord_stream_connection_started` — second clankvox connection opening

### Video receive pipeline (implemented)

- `clankvox_discord_video_state_observed` — voice connection saw OP12/OP18 video state
- `clankvox_native_video_state_received` — capture supervisor applied video state
- `clankvox_native_video_state_emitted` — state emitted over IPC to Bun
- `native_discord_screen_share_state_updated` — Bun updated active-sharer state
- `clankvox_native_video_subscribe_requested` — Rust accepted video subscription
- `clankvox_video_sink_wants_updated` — Rust recalculated OP15 media sink wants
- `clankvox_first_video_frame_forwarded` — first video frame forwarded to Bun
- `stream_watch_frame_ingested` — Bun ingested frame into stream-watch pipeline

### Failure diagnostics

- `screen_watch_native_start_failed` — native path failed, includes `reason`, `nativeActiveSharerCount`, `selectionReason`
- `screen_watch_link_fallback_started` — fell back to share-link, includes `nativeFailureReason`
- `native_discord_stream_transport_link_fallback_requested` — native transport degraded after start and Bun requested link-only recovery
- `native_discord_stream_transport_link_fallback_failed` — degraded native transport could not recover into the share-link path

## Risk Assessment

- **DAVE on stream connections.** Stream connections use DAVE channel ID `BigInt(rtc_server_id) - 1n`. Confirmed working live. However, DAVE per-frame video decrypt does not work for Go Live — the `davey` library classifies Go Live video frames as `UnencryptedWhenPassthroughDisabled` when they are likely encrypted. Video frames that fail DAVE decrypt are dropped to prevent feeding encrypted garbage to ffmpeg. Screen watch currently relies on the initial unencrypted frames that arrive during the DAVE transition window after session commit.
- **PLI/FIR keyframe requests do not work.** clankvox uses `protocol: "udp"` for stream connections. Discord's media server only processes RTCP PLI/FIR feedback from WebRTC peers. PLI/FIR packets are still sent as a best-effort hint, but keyframes cannot be requested on demand. The H264 receive path compensates by always prepending cached SPS+PPS to every frame and treating SPS-containing access units as keyframes.
- **Transport crypto AAD for RTP.** Discord's `rtpsize` AEAD modes authenticate the RTP fixed header + CSRC + 4-byte extension prefix as AAD. The extension body is part of the ciphertext. `decrypt()` recomputes AAD from raw packet bytes and must NOT use `parse_rtp_header`'s `header_size` (which includes the extension body). Inbound RTCP (PT 72-76 per RFC 5761 mux) is filtered before decrypt.
- **ffmpeg H264 decode EOF.** The H264 raw demuxer (`-f h264`) hangs on single-frame files. Bun pipes H264 through `cat | ffmpeg -fflags +genpts -f h264 -i pipe:0` to guarantee EOF delivery.
- **RTX loss recovery is still limited.** The receive path currently traces and drops RTX payloads; retransmission support remains future work.
- **Sender compatibility is narrower than receive.** Outbound publish is still H264-only and still centered on music lifecycle or browser-session share. `visualizerMode: "off"` also depends on a URL-backed source relay path being available.

## Reference: Discord-video-stream

The [`Discord-video-stream`](https://github.com/Discord-RE/Discord-video-stream) library implements the sending side of Go Live for selfbot accounts. Key observations:

- Uses `discord.js-selfbot-v13`, not regular `discord.js` — selfbot tokens may have different capabilities than bot tokens
- `VoiceConnection` for regular voice, `StreamConnection` for Go Live — both extend `BaseMediaConnection`
- Stream connection uses `rtc_server_id` from `STREAM_CREATE` as its `serverId`
- OP0 Identify always includes `video: true` and `streams: [{ type: "screen", rid: "100", quality: 100 }]`
- Video SSRCs come from `OP2 Ready d.streams[0].ssrc` and `d.streams[0].rtx_ssrc`, not `d.video_ssrc`
- Uses `protocol: "webrtc"` with SDP in SelectProtocol, not `protocol: "udp"`
- `STREAM_WATCH` (OP20) is defined but not implemented (library only sends, doesn't watch)
- Speaking flag 2 on the stream connection indicates video streaming

## Reference: Discord-video-selfbot

The [`Discord-video-selfbot`](https://github.com/aiko-chan-ai/Discord-video-selfbot) library is an older sender-side Go Live implementation. Useful observations:

- Uses a second `StreamConnection` for Go Live, separate from the main voice connection
- Fills the stream connection `serverId` from `STREAM_CREATE.rtc_server_id`
- Reuses the main voice `session_id` for the stream leg
- Uses `protocol: "udp"` with standard IP discovery and `SELECT_PROTOCOL`
- Does not implement `STREAM_WATCH` or inbound video receive
- Uses older `xsalsa20_*` encryption modes, so it is not a modern DAVE reference

## Product Language

Prefer:

- "start screen watch"
- "watch your screen"
- "I can start watching that share"
- For spoken voice replies, say "open the link I sent" or "open that screen-share link" instead of reading the full URL aloud.

Avoid:

- "I can already see your screen" unless frame context is actually active
- Reading full screen-share URLs, hostnames, or token strings aloud in voice
- "native Discord watch always works" because it depends on stream discovery working for the selfbot session
