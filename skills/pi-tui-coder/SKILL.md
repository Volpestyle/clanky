# Pi TUI Coder

Keep TypeScript strict and erasable. Use top-level imports, avoid `any`, preserve package boundaries, and prefer existing Pi abstractions over new local protocols.

For TUI work, keep daemon state owned by the daemon and make clients attach through the existing RPC surface rather than duplicating session logic.

## Reference source

Inspect the published Pi packages for current APIs before guessing:

- `/Users/jamesvolpe/dev/external/earendil-works/pi` — Pi monorepo (pi-tui, pi-coding-agent, pi-agent-core). Fall back to `node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-*` if the checkout is absent.

## Notes

- This skill is mirrored across clanky (`clanky-pi/skills/pi-tui-coder`) and agent-room (`agent-room/skills/pi-tui-coder`); keep the copies in sync.
